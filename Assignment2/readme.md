ASSIGNMENT 2

Ok so for the most part this program works in the sense that two people can play and the color will change based on which side won.
Left win will turn green while right win will turn red.

There's this weird glitch in the beginning where the ball will go through the top half of the left paddle and sometimes the bottom half of
the right paddle.
